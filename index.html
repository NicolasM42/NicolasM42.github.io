          Welcome to my website! Here you can learn a little about me, view my resume, and see some projects that I've worked on!
        </p>
        <p>
          Lets start with a little about me. I've lived in Wisconsin for most of my life, and I currently reside in Madison, Wisconsin. I am a recent graduate from UW-Madison,
          with a B.S. in Computer Science and a Certificate in Mathematics (Go Badgers!). During my time at the UW, I not only discovered my passion for programming, but also 
          honed my skills through rigorous classes in subjects such as Algorithms, Graphics, and Security. No matter where I may move to in the future, a piece of me will always
          live in Wisconsin. :)

          <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
          <p>While I do love programming, its not the only thing I like to spend my time doing. Here are some other things you should know about me!</p>
          <p>
            <h5>-Video Games-</h5> 
            Gaming has been a hobby of mine for quite a few years. I always tell people that it was Minecraft that gave me my initial introduction into the world
            of Computer Science, so that alone shows how much I owe to it. Video games have been the source of countless memories for me, from sailing the seas as a pirate in
            Sea of Thieves, to winning tournaments in Rocket League. I've made tons friends along the way, and its a hobby plan to continue well into the future!
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5>-Soccer-</h5> 
            This sport has played a major role in shaping who I am today. I've played since about age 3, and so can't even begin to count the number of games and
            tournaments I played in. Not only did it teach me about the importance of teamwork and practice, but it always provided me my first experiences in a leadership
            position as a team captain in my middle and high school years. Alongside gaming, this is an activity that I plan to continue as long as I live!
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5>-Snowboarding-</h5> 
            By far my favorite winter pastime, I've been 'sheddin the slopes' for about 8 years now. Some of my favorite locations include Granite Peak here
            in Wisconsin, Copper Mountain in Colorado, and Powder Mountain in Utah! I also frequent local slopes such as Tyrol Basin in Mount Horeb, so maybe I'll see you out there 
            sometime!
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5>-Kayaking-</h5> 
            I can't think of a better spent summer day than paddling around on a Wisconsin Lake or River. Some favorite spots of mine are Devil's Lake 
            here in Wisconsin and the Smith River in California.

        This application was the product of a semester long class focused on learning the ins-and-outs of software engineering. The class divided the students into 6 person teams,
        and we were then tasked with developing one of our original software ideas as the semester project. Our team followed a modified waterfall SDL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team decided to develop a React web-app that was designed for UW-Madison students to easily sell their textbooks to other UW students. Some features of our application
        include creating and searching through textbooks listings, an in-house chat system, and a responsive user-interface. The project was a success, and it was a great experience.

        As an avid gamer, it had always been a dream of mine to design and develop a game of my very own. This project is the product of that ambition. For inspiration,
        I drew from one of favorite arcade games: Galaga. You will see some similar themes between my game and this timeless classic. To complete this project, I learned
        the basics of the Swift programming language, and also utilized Photoshop to create original art.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main development for the game was completed during the summer after my Sophomore year at UW-Madison, and the game is available for download through the Apple
        App Store on iOS devices. I continue to monitor its playability and update it as needed.

        As a Computer Scientist and Software Developer, what better way to display your work than through a website that you created?! This website will serve as
        a portfolio for me as I continue my career as a programmer, and will be updated as I continue to grow and improve my skills.
